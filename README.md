# Java OOP, Data Structures, and Algorithms

This repository contains a collection of university projects implemented in Java, focusing on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), data structures, and algorithms. These projects demonstrate various programming concepts, data handling techniques, and algorithmic problem-solving skills.

## Project Overview
The main objectives of this repository are:
1. **Understanding OOP Principles**: Demonstrating concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism through practical examples.
2. **Implementing Data Structures**: Creating and manipulating common data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
3. **Algorithm Implementation**: Implementing and analyzing various algorithms, including sorting, searching, and graph algorithms.

## Projects Included
Each project folder contains a Java implementation along with explanations and comments for better understanding. The following topics are covered:

- **Object-Oriented Programming**
  - Classes and Objects
  - Inheritance
  - Interfaces
  - Polymorphism
- **Data Structures**
  - Arrays and ArrayLists
  - Linked Lists (Singly and Doubly)
  - Stacks and Queues
  - Trees (Binary Trees, BST)
  - Graphs (Adjacency List, Matrix)
- **Algorithms**
  - Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Merge, Quick, etc.)
  - Searching Algorithms (Linear, Binary Search)
  - Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra's)
